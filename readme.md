# Search Fight

Search Engines battle to get a winner.

## Getting Started

This project requires setting up API Urls and API keys for the two search engines we use. (Google and Bing). Google will need also a Custom Search API ID found in the Google Console.
If you would like to add a new service you just need to add a new service class that implement IService interface and the application will take care of the rest. Also, keep in mind
that you will need to set up configuration to every service in appconfig file.
